The purpose of this project is to port Haskell SDL tutorial from http://web.animal-machine.com:8080/blog/2010/04/getting-started-with-sdl-in-haskell to Common Lisp.

Although my first decision was to use ECL and its native FFI support, I changed the decision on the fly.
I switched to lispbuilder-sdl since writing SDL FFI bindings manually was pretty tedious task.

Also, I switched to SBCL from ECL, since lispbuilder-sdl was not working with ECL. The code is portable, so it should work with any CL implementation that supports CFFI.
